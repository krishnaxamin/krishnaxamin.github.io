## What is Systems Biology?
A difficult question to answer, in my opinion. The main idea of Systems Biology (SysBio) is in the name - considering the whole system, not just its constituent parts, since the system is greater than the sum of its parts. An example of this thinking is to examine not just how one protein regulates the expression of a gene, but instead study how all the proteins in the cell regulate the expression of all the genes in the cell. The systems that could be studied range from cells to ecosystems. 

'Data! Data! Data! I cannot make bricks without clay' - Sherlock Holmes, _The Adventure of the Copper Beeches_. Large and complex systems output data, which we can measure at increasingly large volumes and detail. To understand these systems as SysBio wishes to requires dealing with this data, which is often measured in terms of terabytes, in a structured and quantitative manner. So a large part of SysBio is the handling and quantitative analysis of big data. The insights drawn from analyses form hypotheses and models, which are ideally taken from the computer back into the laboratory to be experimentally validated, although this is not always possible. Data generated from experiments then heads back to the computers, to be analysed once more and geenrate more hypotheses and better models.

'What I cannot create, I do not understand' - _Richard Feynmann_. Systems biology and synthetic biology go hand-in-hand. To me, the end goal of SysBio is to build an understanding of whole systems complete enough that those systems can be replicated in simulations or in reality - the latter of which is the realm of synthetic biology. Once we think we understand the systems, we can test and develop our understanding by recreating the systems. Indeed, Professor Jonathan Karr at the Icahn School of Medicine has already built a complete simulation of an entire cell, so that we can watch every detail of how it lives. Professor Jason Chin at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology has reworked how proteins are made to introduce new, unnatural building blocks into proteins. These require an understanding of how cells and cellular processes work at a large-scale, systems level, which systems biology seeks to provide.
