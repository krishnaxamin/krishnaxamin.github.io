Academic interests in complex systems and networks. 

Professional interests in supporting the translation of science into real impact, whether that be in academia, in biotech/industry, in consulting, as an operator, or as an investor. 

Hobbying interests in tennis, music, squash, motorsports, things network-related (e.g. maps), and summer day trips attempting to summit Swiss peaks with a breakfast bar and nothing else (wouldn't recommend).
