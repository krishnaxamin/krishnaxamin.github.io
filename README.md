## About me

## Education

### University of Cambridge, St Catharine's College (2018 - )
* MSCi, Systems Biology (2021 - 2022)
* BA (Hons), Natural Sciences (2018 - 2021)
I am in my last year of my undergrduate degree, where I am reading Natural Sciences, specialising in Biochemistry. I plan to continue for Part III (one-year Master's) in Systems Biology. Find out more about the modules I have taken, what 'Systems Biology' means, and what the course may have in store for me.

At Cambridge, I have been involved with the Scientific Society, with the Lawn Tennis Club, in various ensembles and orchestras, with the Synthetic Biology Society and with the Finance and Investment Society. Find out more about what I got up to.

### Winchester College (2013 - 2018)
I came into Winchester College an academic scholar. This meant living in the medieval heart of the school, in College - the Scholars' 'house'. As a scholar, I was one of the lucky few to wear a gown - magnificent items of clothing that had pockets deep enough to fit books, water bottles and pencil cases, and that were the school's only stipulated piece of uniform. 

During my time at Winchester, I was involved in tennis, music and community service. Find out about what I got up to. 

### Colet Court - now St Paul's Juniors (2007 - 2013)

## Experience

### Scientific Research
* Enzyme-explicit modelling of histone methylation dyanmics - _Gunawardena Lab, Harvard Medical School_
* Molecular mechansims of signal transduction through GABAAR - _Lummis Lab, Deparment of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge_ 
* Human lineage-specific regulation of novel open reading frames in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder - _Prabakran Group, Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge_ 
  * First-author on a manuscript including this work - currently in peer review at _**Molecular Psychiatry**_ 
I have done both purely computational and laboratory work. 

Over the summer of 2020, I was fortunate enough to conduct my research remotely. I investigated genetic causes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in non-coding regions of the genome (stretches of DNA that are not thought to produce functional proteins) and questioned whether those causes were specific to the human evolutionary lineage. The analyses were performed using Python algorithms I wrote from scratch - one algorithm outperformed a published tool. The results are being written up into a manuscript for publication.

My Part II (3rd year) project looked at the molecular mechanisms of GABAA receptors. GABAA receptors are important signal transducers in the brain. They are implicated in many disorders, including epilepsy, and are targeted by a wide variety of drugs, including benzodiazepines and ethanol. I am working on a Pytnon pipeline to automate part of the experimental design process.
