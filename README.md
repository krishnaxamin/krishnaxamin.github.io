## Experience

### Scientific Research
* Enzyme-explicit modelling of histone methylation dyanmics - _Gunawardena Lab, Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School_

I have done both purely computational and laboratory work. 

Over the summer of 2020, I was fortunate enough to conduct my research remotely. I investigated genetic causes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in non-coding regions of the genome (stretches of DNA that are not thought to produce functional proteins) and questioned whether those causes were specific to the human evolutionary lineage. The analyses were performed using Python algorithms I wrote from scratch - one algorithm outperformed a published tool. The results are being written up into a manuscript for publication.

My Part II (3rd year) project looked at the molecular mechanisms of GABAA receptors. GABAA receptors are important signal transducers in the brain. They are implicated in many disorders, including epilepsy, and are targeted by a wide variety of drugs, including benzodiazepines and ethanol. I am working on a Pytnon pipeline to automate part of the experimental design process.
