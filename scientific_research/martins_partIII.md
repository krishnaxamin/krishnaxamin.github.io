# Off-target toxic effects of drugs on happyhour - Mitochondria and Cell Death Regulation Group, MRC Toxicology Unit
_Started Nov 2021. Ongoing_

happyhour is a protein whose downregulation results in increased alcohol intake in _Drosophila melanogaster_ (fruit flies) and is associated with alcoholism in humans. We hypothesise that small molecules, i.e. drugs, could interfere with the kinase domain of happyhour, leading to decreased activity. 

This project plans to use _in silico_ and _in vivo_ techniques: machine learning, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and assays in fruit flies. 

In progress...
