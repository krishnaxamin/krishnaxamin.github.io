# Data Analyst Intern at 2RSquared
_Dec 2019 - Jan 2020_

Working for a financial technology start-up in systematic asset management, I sourced and researched unstructured repo rate data from 9 central banks and wrote a widely-applicable algorithm in Python 3 to prepare the data for wider use within the company. While I improved my coding skills greatly during my month there, the more valuable experience was being a part of a start-up, listening to the conversations had and the decisions made.

The code written and used in this internship is available [here](https://github.com/krishnaxamin/repo_rate_web_scraping_cleaning).
