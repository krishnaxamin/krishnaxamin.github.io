# Algorithmic Trading Intern at HashKey Group 
_Aug - Sep 2021_

By analysing the performance of a successful trading strategy, I identified market features in BNB/BTC, ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC and BTC futures. I then related these market features to the trading strategy's behaviour to code a trading algorithm that, under preliminary analysis, outperformed the trading strategy on which it was based. 

The Python 3 code written for this internship is not currently available.
