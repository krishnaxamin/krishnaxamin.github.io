# Healthcare Equities Analyst at the Cambridge Apex Fund
_Nov 2020 - Mar 2021_

As an Equities Analyst in the Healthcare team, I worked with seven other team members to scout the market landscape to find potential targets for investment within our investment universe. I then performed due diligence, comparable company analysis and discounted cash flow analysis to construct an investment thesis for the company our team had chosen. 

The Cambridge Apex Fund is a student-managed, long-only fund investing across all major sectors.
